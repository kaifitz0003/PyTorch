# Convolution 

Convolution is where we have a kernel and a input. We slide the kernel over the input, multiplying and adding the results (calculations show in slide show).

# 1d Convolution

Below are the slides to 1D Convolution.

The calculations below use the first weights/kernel and first inputs in the data. This was done earlier.
